## 5️⃣ Charges – The Currency of Power

| Charge | Type | How You Get It | How You Spend It |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Negative** | ⚡ | Rolling 2 dice (1‑6 each). Avg 3.5 per turn. | Attack & defense costs. |
| **Positive** | 🔋 | Rolling 2 dice (1‑6 each) and getting a 6. Avg 0.31 per turn. | Special & ultimate abilities. |

### Charge Costs (simplified)

| Card Tier | Cost | Damage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier 1 (Basic) | 2 neg | 2 dmg |
| Tier 2 (Standard) | 3 neg | 3 dmg |
| Tier 3 (Heavy) | 5 neg | 5 dmg |
| Tier 4 (Ultimate) | 1 pos | 3‑7 dmg (varies) |

*Positive‑cost cards are rarer and usually game‑changing.*

* * *

## 6️⃣ Attacking & Defending

### Attack Power

| Cost | Tier | Base Damage | Form Bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 neg | Form 1 | 1 | 0 |
| 2 neg | Form 2 | 2 | +1 |
| 3 neg | Form 3 | 3 | +2 |
| 4 neg | Form 4 | 4 | +3 |
| … | … | … | … |

**Quick rule:** *Damage ≈ (Cost × 0.8) + Form Bonus.*

### Defense Power

| Cost | Type | Block / Shield |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Passive | 1 block or 1‑3 shield (depending on form) |
| 1 neg | Active | 1‑3 block / 2‑4 shield |
| 2 neg | Heavy | 2‑4 block / 3‑6 shield |
| 1 pos | Special | 3‑7 block / 4‑10 shield |

**Quick rule:** *Block ≈ (Cost × 0.7) + Form Bonus + Passive.*

* * *

## 7️⃣ Trick Cards – The Reaction Engine

-   **Response Window:** Every trick card creates a new window for the opponent to react.
    
-   **Stack Order:** *Last In, First Out* (LIFO).
    
-   **Timing:** Some must be played immediately; others can be delayed.
    
-   **Balance Tip:** Pair offensive tricks with defensive tricks of similar power.
    

* * *

## 8️⃣ Winning the Game

| Condition | How It Happens | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Shield Zero** | Opponent’s total shield points reach 0. | Anytime. |
| **Deck Empty** | Opponent draws from an empty deck. | Usually around turn 22. |

* * *

## 9️⃣ Deck Depletion – A Secondary Victory

-   **Why it matters:** Forces you to play more aggressively and use your deck as a resource.
    
-   **Tip:** Keep some “draw” or “discard” tricks to thin the opponent’s deck faster.
    

* * *

## 🔟 Play‑testing & Tweaks

-   **Track:** Game length, damage per turn, charge usage, slot usage.
    
-   **Watch for red flags:**
    
    -   Games < 8 turns → damage too high.
        
    -   Games > 30 turns → damage too low.
        
    -   Positive charges never used → too expensive.
        
    -   Slots always full → need more trade‑offs.
        

Feel free to adjust card counts or tweak cost formulas based on your playgroup’s feedback!
