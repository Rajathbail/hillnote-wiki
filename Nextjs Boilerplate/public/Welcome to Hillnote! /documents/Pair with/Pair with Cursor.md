## My favourite way to work with Cursor is to

1.  Use the **Cursor app** for project files with MCP enabled to Hillnote.
    
2.  Add the Hillnote workspace within your cursor project as reference or notes.
    
3.  Sync the Workspace along with the project via Github.
    
4.  Setup a Cursor Rule in settings to write all documents/.md files in `<workspace folder name>/documents/cursorDocs`

## Readme rules

Save all documentation created in cursor to Hillnote to keep your work organized and easy to find.

Simply add a Cursor Rule in settings to write all documents/.md files in `<workspace folder name>/documents/cursorDocs`

## Open your workspace

You can navigate to the workspace folder - open the same in Cursor. You can make changes, modify files and even create tools using Cursor.

## Via another app

**Github** can be used to sync your files and connect them to your Cursor. This works great when paired with the background agent to automate workflows.
