## My favourite way to work with Claude is to

1.  use the **Claude Desktop app** for general tasks with MCP enabled to Hillnote & Filesystem
    
2.  **Claude Code** for execution within the cursor IDE with MCP enabled to Hillnote
    
3.  **Sync my files to Google drive** and connect it with my **Claude app** to continue conversations in mobile on the move
    

### Claude Desktop

1.  Linking Hillnote with Claude desktop is a single button click in settings > MCP > connect with Claude > Auto configure
    
2.  Once configured restart Claude
    
3.  Verify the connection by asking Claude to list your workspaces

### Claude Code

1.  **Connect the MCP with Claude Code:** [https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) is a great article to refer to
    
2.  **Open the workspace in Claude Code:** Navigate to the workspace folder - open the same in claude code and you are good to go
    
3.  **Embed the Hillnote workspace in your project/code folder as notes.** You can pair it with Github to keep it in sync across your team as well!
    

### Claude Projects

1.  Once you have a certain set of documents ready to use as permanent reference you can upload the .md files directly to Claude within a “Project space”. These **documents will then be referenced in all future responses giving you a great project assistant to speak with (even on mobile when you’re on the move.)**
    
2.  You can always ask Claude to prepare a document for you and then **simply save the document within your workspace/documents** to then have it immediately appear within your Hillnote workspace.

### Via another app

Apps like **Google Drive, Github** can be used to sync your files and connect them to your Claude account as a connector. This allows Claude to reference documents, allows you to attach documents, etc directly from the cloud system.
