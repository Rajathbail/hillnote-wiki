## My favourite way to work with Perplexity is to

1.  use the **Perplexity Desktop app** for general tasks with MCP enabled to Hillnote & Filesystem
    
2.  **Sync my files to Google-drive** and connect it with my **Perplexity Account** to continue conversations in mobile on the move
    

### Perplexity Desktop App

1.  Linking Hillnote with the Perplexity app is fairly simple and fairly well explained here: [https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/11502712-local-and-remote-mcps-for-perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/help-center/en/articles/11502712-local-and-remote-mcps-for-perplexity)
    
    1.  Download the mac app
        
    2.  Go to connectors and download the additional package required
        
    3.  Click on Add connector and paste the configuration JSON into the required fields
        
2.  Once configured restart Perplexity
    
3.  Verify the connection by asking Perplexity to list your workspaces

### Perplexity Spaces

1.  Once you have a certain set of documents ready to use as permanent reference you can upload the .md files directly to Perplexity within a “Space”. These **documents will then be referenced in all future responses giving you a great project assistant to speak with (even on mobile when you’re on the move.)**
    
2.  You can always ask Perplexity to prepare a document for you and then **simply save the document within your workspace/documents** to then have it immediately appear within your Hillnote workspace.

### Via another app

Apps like **Google Drive, Github** can be used to sync your files and connect them to your Perplexity account as a source. This allows Perplexity to reference documents, allows you to attach documents, etc directly from the cloud system.
