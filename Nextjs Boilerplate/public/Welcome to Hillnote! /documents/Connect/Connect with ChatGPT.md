**==ChatGPT only allows for custom extensions for ChatGPT Pro or enterprise users==**

## My favourite way to work with ChatGPT is to

1.  use the **ChatGPT Desktop app (Requires ChatGPT Pro)** for general tasks with MCP enabled to Hillnote
    
2.  **Sync my files to Google-drive** and connect it with my **ChatGPT app** to continue conversations in mobile on the move
    

### ChatGPT Desktop

1.  Linking Hillnote with ChatGPT desktop is easy
    
    1.  Copy the configuration code
        
    2.  ChatGPT > Settings > Connectors > Custom
        
2.  Once configured restart ChatGPT
    
3.  Verify the connection by asking ChatGPT to list your workspaces
    

> An alternative is to connect your Google Drive/Github to ChatGPT and then sync your files via there, While you can’t edit files - you will be able to read and reference files easily

### ChatGPT Projects

1.  Once you have a certain set of documents ready to use as permanent reference you can upload the .md files directly to ChatGPT within a “Project space”. These **documents will then be referenced in all future responses giving you a great project assistant to speak with (even on mobile when you’re on the move.)**
    
2.  You can always ask ChatGPT to prepare a document for you and then **simply save the document within your workspace/documents** to then have it immediately appear within your Hillnote workspace.

### Via another app

Apps like **Google Drive, Github** can be used to sync your files and connect them to your ChatGPT account as a connector. This allows ChatGPT to reference documents, allows you to attach documents, etc directly from the cloud system.
