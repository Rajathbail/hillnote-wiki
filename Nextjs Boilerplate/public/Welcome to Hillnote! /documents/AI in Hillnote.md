# **==AI in Hillnote 🚀==**

### **Setup and Getting started with AI**

Hillnote empowers you to take control of your AI, and you don’t need to set everything up at once. Begin by exploring the **AI Tab in the Library**

you’ll discover a wide range of AI models to choose from. Pick the one that suits your needs and download it immediately! Before you start, be sure to check its performance rating on your machine for the best results.

## **==Using the AI==**

Once its downloaded, open a document and click on the ✨ icon in the top bar to toggle it on and off. **It works even when you're offline 😉**

> *The AI model also has a view of the document you are writing so it takes that into account as context for all of its replies.*

### **In the editor**

You can **access the AI options** by selecting any piece of text to pull up the context menu

**The Sparkle** fixes both spellings and grammar of the selected text and replaces the same

**The wand** helps run a set of pre-defined prompts

> *Pro tip: You could add one of your own prompts here in settings*

**The type** helps run a custom prompt on the selected text

> *Pro tip: Deep thinking may take longer but is great when you need a more elaborate response*

### **In the Sidebar**

**Chat** allows you to talk directly to your AI assistant. You can add any text there directly to your editor and even add it to context for the AI to refer to later.

**Assistant** is a peer writing helper that checks and rewrites your paragraphs based on the given task. Like what you see? Click on "add to editor" to replace your text.

You can either use a preset prompt or give your AI a custom command by clicking on the “type” button – like how we used “Simplify” below!

### **Search your document**

Enabling AI search (cmd/ctrl + F) in your document allows you to talk to your document and ask the AI questions about your content. The AI searches through what it has and then returns answers accordingly.

### **Search your document==s (plural)==**

You can also directly talk to your entire library by using the AI search feature within the Library screen – simply type your question and get instant answers.

### **AI generation**

Need a fresh document and a starting point? Perhaps you’re looking for a draft, a creative prompt, or even want to weave in a winter-themed poem? AI generation allows you to directly create text from your AI model.

### **Deep thinking mode**

Deep thinking mode is a great way to generate more elaborate responses and to get detailed answers out of your AI. You'll find it littered everywhere. Do keep in mind that these tend to take longer and requires a few minutes atleast.
