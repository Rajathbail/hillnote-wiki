## My favourite way to work with Google drive is to

1.  Use the Google Drive app to have a folder in my laptop that syncs via the drive
    
2.  Store all workspaces in the drive folder
    
3.  Share individual workspaces as I see fit.
    
4.  Connecting Google drive to an AI assistant of my choice (Claude, Open AI, etc)
    

## Google Drive App

Install the app onto your system and setup the folder on your machine.

## Collaborate

### Share

**Share with individuals:** Click on share and add individual emails to share the workspace with.

**Share with the team:** If using a team space or drive for enterprise make sure to add your files in shared drives to share it across the team.

### Add to your drive

Make sure to add the shared workspace to your drive by dragging and dropping it to your drive. This will make it visible in your local machine.

## Handling Conflict

When there’s conflict in a Google drive file (usually when some edits are made offline by 2 users on the same file) a second file is created with a “conflict” suffix. You can resolve the conflict manually.

## Connect to other apps

**Google drive connects** to Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, etc via connectors which provides access to all synced files to the assistant. This is great when working on the move and accessing the files via your phone and other devices.
