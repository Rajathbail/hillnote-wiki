### Grok, Deepseek Projects & Gemini Gems

1.  Once you have a certain set of documents ready to use as permanent reference you can upload the .md files directly to the assistant of your choice within a “Project/gem space”. These **documents will then be referenced in all future responses giving you a great project assistant to speak with (even on mobile when you’re on the move.)**
    
2.  You can always ask your assistance to prepare a .md document for you and then **simply save the document within your workspace/documents** to then have it immediately appear within your Hillnote workspace.
    

### Via another app

Some assistants can connect with your apps like **Google Drive, Github** to sync your files directly to the platform. This allows the assistant to reference documents, allows you to attach documents, etc directly from the cloud system.
