# **==Hello!👋🏽==**

Welcome to Hillnote! We’re so excited to have you here and thank you for giving it a try. 🎉

This quick guide will provide you with an overview of the app and some ideas to help you get started. We do hope you enjoy exploring!

(12 minutes if you want to read the advanced stuff too)

# ==What is Hillnote?==

Hillnote is a **local first, note-taking app designed to supercharge your AI workflow**. Create notes and documents that are ready to be integrated with all of your favourite AI tools including but not limited to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Deep Seek, Perplexity, Cursor, Github CoPilot and more!

Hillnote also comes with Ollama built in, letting you run powerful local Large Language Models – like Gemma, GPT-OSS, Llama, Phi, and DeepSeek – directly from the app, even when offline. 🎉

# ==Workspaces and file structure==

Within Hillnote, everything is organised inside of a workspace document – you decide exactly where it’s stored. These workspaces contain both documents, formatted in easy-to-use Markdown (.md) files (which AI models and agents particularly favour!), and helpful resources like a readme and document registry, designed to streamline any AI agent’s work within the space.

[[The Filesystem|doc:documents/The Filesystem.md]] goes over what each file/folder does.

Hey There! I'm Rajath, the guy who build Hillnote and I just want to say thank you so much for giving it a try! This is an example of a comment which helps users collaborate and leave notes scattered within Hillnote. One of the many features we keep adding to App and hopefully one of the features you grow to love :) Anyways. You should probably get back to completing whats next in [1]

Btw - this too is locally stored (within the document to be precise) so these comments here are only for those folks who you share the file with! 🎉
