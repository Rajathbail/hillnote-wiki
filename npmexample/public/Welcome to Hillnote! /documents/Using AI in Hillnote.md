### **Setup and Getting started with AI**

Hillnote empowers you to take control of your AI, and you donâ€™t need to set everything up at once. Begin by exploring the **AI Tab in the Library**

![](resources/images/Make it yours/1757064527325.png)Youâ€™ll discover a wide range of AI models to choose from. Pick the one that suits your needs and download it immediately! Before you start, be sure to check its performance rating on your machine for the best results.

## **==Using the AI==**

Once its downloaded, open a document and youâ€™re ready to get started. **It works even when you're offline ðŸ˜‰**

> *The AI model also has a view of the document you are writing so it takes that into account as context for all of its replies.*

### **In the Sidebar**

**Chat** allows you to talk directly to your AI assistant. You can add any text there directly to your editor and even add it to context for the AI to refer to later.

### **AI generation**

Need a fresh document and a starting point? Perhaps youâ€™re looking for a draft, a creative prompt, or even want to weave in a winter-themed poem? AI generation allows you to directly create text from your AI model.

### **Deep thinking mode**

Deep thinking mode is a great way to generate more elaborate responses and to get detailed answers out of your AI. You'll find it littered everywhere. Do keep in mind that these tend to take longer and requires a few minutes atleast.
