# **==The editor 📝==**

## **Basics**

1.  Toggle between light mode and dark mode by clicking the ☼ / ☾ section in Settings
    
2.  The **format bar up top** should be self explanatory, some cool features we do have is a **youtube embed, AI Generation, Scratch space** - You can remove the format bar in settings 🎈
    
3.  There is also a **word count** at the bottom
    
4.  **Enter a "/" anywhere** to see the inline commands (these tend to be the same commands as the format bar up top)
