## My favourite way to work with Github CoPilot is to

1.  Use **VScode + Copilot** for project files with MCP enabled to Hillnote.
    
2.  Add the Hillnote workspace within your **VScode** project as reference or notes.
    
3.  Sync the Workspace along with the project via Github.
    
4.  Setup a **Copilot** Rule in settings to write all documents/.md files in `<workspace folder name>/documents/copilotDocs`
    

## MCP connection

To enable the MCP connection to hillnote read the documents available at [https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/extend-copilot-chat-with-mcp](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/extend-copilot-chat-with-mcp)

## Readme rules

Save all documentation created in Copilot to Hillnote to keep your work organized and easy to find.

Simply add a Copilot Rule in settings to write all documents/.md files in `<workspace folder name>/documents/copilotDocs`

## Open your workspace

You can navigate to the workspace folder - open the same in **VScode**. You can make changes, modify files and even create tools using Copilot.
